# Correlating Node Centrality Metrics with Node Resilience in Self-healing Systems with Limited Neighbourhood Information.

This repository contains the experimental information developed in the paper  Correlating Node Centrality Metrics with Node Resilience in Self-healing Systems with Limited Neighbourhood Information.

The failure simulator and the self-healing algorithm is implemented in Java at the following link: https://github.com/arleserp/NetworkRecoverySim
