# Correlating Node Centrality Metrics with Node Resilience in Self-healing Systems with Limited Neighbourhood Information.

This repository contains the experimental information developed in the paper  Correlating Node Centrality Metrics with Node Resilience in Self-healing Systems with Limited Neighbourhood Information.

The failure simulator and the self-healing algorithm is implemented in Java at the following link: https://github.com/arleserp/NetworkRecoverySim

## Structure of project 

[selected_networks.gephi](https://github.com/arleserp/CorrelatingNodeCentrality/blob/main/selected_networks.gephi)

Gephi especifications for each graph are here 

[Network specs folder](https://github.com/arleserp/CorrelatingNodeCentrality/tree/main/network_specs)

The folder contains information about the properties of each node in the selected networks:

- closnesscentrality
- eigenvectorcentrality
- degree
- betweenesscentrality
- eccentricity
- pagerank
